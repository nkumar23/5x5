    In 17th-century Japan, Sashiko emerged as a method of visible mending, a way to prolong the life of cloth through patterned stitches. Each thread was a gesture of survival, repetition, and care. These works extend that logic into the digital realm.

Starting with a glitch, a rupture in the smooth surface of code, I printed the error onto fabric, sewing it into a wearable object. Then, I photographed the shirt and glitched it again. The result is a layered act of digital and material repair, a recursive performance of breakage and reassembly.

Like Sashiko, these glitches don’t hide the wound. They illuminate it. They ask: what happens when we tend to the error instead of erasing it? What ancient methods might we apply to broken systems of the future?
